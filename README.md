# Sentiment-and-Emotion-Recognition-from-Texts-Using-Deep-Neural-Network
In this project, we have applied a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based deep neural network with an additional attention layer for classifying sentiments and emotions from texts. We have done several standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like data cleaning, word-level tokenization, and word-to-vector conversion to get improved classification results. The model's performance was evaluated using four different evaluation metrics on three different data sets in two languages. The codes were written in Python, mostly using the PyTorch library to build and train the deep neural network. The experiments were run using a laptop having RTX 3050 GPU.
